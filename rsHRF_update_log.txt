code SPM plugin - additions and modifications to v1.0:
------ v2.3, 202009 ----------- 
Add a demo for LFP-IOS data analysis (rsHRF_demo_LFP_IOS.m).
Add some demo scipts for UCLA BOLD-fMRI data analysis (rsHRF_demo_UCLA_batch.m),including:
--Add a demo for multivariate analysis of variance (manova.m) analysis.
--Add a script for connectome-based predictive modeling analysis(rsHRF_CPM.m).
Update HRF deconvolution algorithm (rsHRF_iterative_wiener_deconv.m). 
Modify several scripts name.
Add partial correlation analysis. 
Split the subfunctions in rsHRF.m into several independent codes.
----------------------- 

------ v2.2, 201909 ----------- 
Change the GUI (add surface analysis panel and Display).
Add rsHRF_viewer.m for HRF shapes visualization.
Add a m-file (rsHRF_mvgc.m) for multivariate Granger causality analysis.
Update HRF basis functions, add Gamma/Fourier basis function (more flexible, and supporting finer temporal grid). 
Update (s)FIR model, using AR(k) for autocorrelated noise modeling.
Add a m-file (rsHRF_estimation_impulseest.m, see code for help) for nonparametric impulse response estimation (not included in rsHRF GUI). 
----------------------- 

------ v2.1, 201908 ----------- 
Add suface-based analysis module. 
-----------------------

------ v2.0, 201901 ----------- 
Add functional (Pearson/Spearman correlation) and effective (Pairwise/Conditional/Partially Conditioned Granger causality) connectivity analysis module.
Add rsHRF_install_SPM.m to facilitate the installation of the SPM plugin.
